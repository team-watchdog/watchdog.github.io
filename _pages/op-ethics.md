# General Principles

Large portions of this guide are taken verbatim from the New York Times Guidelines on Integrity to avoid reinventing the wheel, especially portions of the text in Quotations, Anonymity and its Devices, Fictional Devices and Photography and Images, and Handling Conflict:
Our Purpose

## Skin in the game:

    1) To examine rumors and misinformation that has the potential to harm the public, and to ensure that true facts about each case are laid out and presented to the public in an objective, easily digestible manner.
    
    2) To investigate matters of importance to public interest.

We do not claim to be impartial observers; such a thing is impossible. We have skin in the game. Our interest is in promoting truth, nuance, detail and conceptual clarity of matters that affect the welfare or well-being of the general public. This often means (but is not limited to) matters of infrastructure, healthcare, environment, education outcomes, legislature, and non-trivial affairs of the body politic.

We do not strive to break news: we strive for accuracy, and to be as close to the final word on a matter as possible, in the three major languages spoken in Sri Lanka. It is better to be slow and come to the table knowing a great deal than to barge in clutching at straws.

## How we approach information

    1) In our work, we use a lot of data gathered by third-party organizations, be it government, research units or other news organizations. When we do so, we credit them.
   
    2) Trust nothing and no-one. Neither professional bodies nor academic titles are to be taken at face value. Anecdotal evidence is only evidence of an anecdote. Assemble multiple data points.
   
    3) When tracing information, whether text, image or video, always attempt to establish the point of origin and the date of origin.
    
    4) Research studies, when being considered for inclusion, must first be read thoroughly to examine the sample space and methods used in the study. For this, examine the ‘methodology’ section (and ‘data’ section, if there is one) in a paper. Cite the full study in footnotes, APA style, and mention the sample space in the content itself.
    
    5) Also understand that research papers also indulge in narrative: authors will typically cite other work as evidence or a target for their argument. Check the abstracts and summary sections of the papers cited in the introduction of a paper to see whether the papers cited actually say what the authors claim. Lastly, when mentioning a study, “scientists say” or “a study said” is not enough.
    
    6)Third-party facts or reports cited must preferably be confirmed by another news organization; the best preference is for us to call up whoever is responsible or central to the matter and obtain direct quotes, recorded, regarding the matter. We should clearly distinguish between personal interviews, press statements, observations gathered at events such as press conferences, telephone or email interviews, and written statements.

Attribution to another publication, though, cannot serve as license to print rumors that would not meet our own standards. For example, if a claim is made that 50% of Sri Lankans have experienced credit card fraud, we must locate the source of the claim and examine it to understand how the claim was generated. Did the source interview every Sri Lankan? Did they (as in most commonly done with research) examine a cross-section of the Sri Lankan population? Was this cross-section demographically and geographically representative of the population of Sri Lanka? Is the cross-section actually big enough to account for outliers, statistical errors, and sampling bias?

The highest level of accuracy is generally accorded to a national census: ie: a representative sample that interviews 10% of the population of a country. However, we must be aware that even in such work, ontological errors reduce data or generate misleading results.

Take, for example, the Censuses of India conducted by the British from 1865 onwards. The British found themselves knee-deep in the task of planning and running a country that was, in reality, closer to an entire continent full of different tribes, countries and other social constructs. Starting with the North-West provinces, they began to run a systematic set of exercises to quantify India’s population, noting down everything from age to caste to religion. The British Census-takers logged over 4000 different “castes” by 1931, and then in subsequent Censuses, embarked on the process of reducing the complex and chaotic social interactions of India to a greatly simplified and inescapable 4-caste system built on the Brahmanic system. [1] [2]. Or, take Myanmar’s Census, which consistently refused to count the Rohingya.

The Yale political scientist and anthropologist James Scott describes the actions of a state, when collecting data, as a form of simplification, to make understandable what was previously unique to a particular place or community and mysterious to outsiders. [3]

    “These state simplifications, the basic givens of modern statecraft were . . . rather like abridged maps.  They did not successfully represent the actual activity of the society they depicted, nor were they intended to; they represented only that slice of it that interested the official observer.  They were . . . not just maps . . . [but] when allied with state power, would enable much of the reality they depicted to be remade.

States are not the only sources that produce flawed maps of reality. Newspapers do it all the time, as do well-meaning activists and researchers, either because they favor a particular narrative, have ontological blind spots, or do not have the budget to sample properly, or simply do not understand how to process information.

“A map,” to quote Alfred Korzybski, father of general semantics, “is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.”

This is not something to be taken lightly. Even with the best or lightest, surveys and reporting can easily reduce the amount of information in the real world to a crude set of variables (thus: inaccurate), and it is almost always outdated by the time anyone gets around to looking at the data (thus: slow). At all times we must be aware of this fundamental nature of data, and interpret accordingly [4].

## Quotations

Readers should be able to assume that every word between quotation marks is what the speaker or writer said. We do not “clean up” quotations. If a subject’s grammar or taste is unsuitable, quotation marks should be removed and the awkward passage paraphrased. Unless the writer has detailed notes or a recording, it is usually wise to paraphrase long comments, since they may turn up worded differently on television or in other publications.

The writer should, of course, omit extraneous syllables like “um” and may judiciously delete false starts. If any further omission is necessary, close the quotation, insert new attribution and begin another quotation. In every case, writer and editor must both be satisfied that the intent of the subject has been preserved.
Anonymity and Its Devices

The use of unidentified sources is reserved for situations in which the newspaper could not otherwise print information it considers newsworthy and reliable. When possible, reporter and editor should discuss any promise of anonymity before it is made, or before the reporting begins on a story that may result in such a commitment. (Some topics, like criminal justice or national security, may carry standing authorization for the reporter to grant anonymity.)

The general rule is to tell readers as much as we can about the placement and known motivation of the source. While we avoid automatic phrases about a source’s having “insisted on anonymity,” we should try to state tersely what kind of understanding was actually reached by reporter and source, especially when we can shed light on the source’s reasons.

We will not dissemble about its sources — does not, for example, refer to a single person as “sources’ and does not say “other officials’ when quoting someone who has already been cited by name. There can be no prescribed formula for such attribution, but it should be literally truthful, and not coy.
Fictional Devices

No reader should find cause to suspect that the paper would knowingly alter facts. For that reason, we refrain outright from assigning fictional names, ages, places or dates, and it strictly limits the use of other concealment devices.

If compassion or the unavoidable conditions of reporting require shielding an identity, the preferred solution is to omit the name and explain the omission. (That situation might arise, for example, in an interview conducted inside a hospital or a school governed by privacy rules.) If a complex narrative must distinguish among several shielded identities, it may be necessary to use given names with last initials or, less desirable, given names alone (Hilary K.; Ashley M.; Terry). Descriptions may serve instead (the lawyer; the Morristown psychotherapist). As a rare last resort, if genuine given names would be too revealing, real or coined single initials (Dr. D, Ms. L) may be used after consultation with senior editors. The article must indicate the device and the reason.
Photography and Images

Images that purport to depict reality must be genuine in every way. No people or objects may be added, rearranged, reversed, distorted or removed from a scene (except for the recognized practice of cropping to omit extraneous outer portions). Adjustments of color or gray scale should be limited to those minimally necessary for clear and accurate reproduction, analogous to the “burning” and “dodging” that formerly took place in darkroom processing of images. Pictures of news situations must not be posed.

A credit line is obligatory in all such cases. Occasionally, an explanatory caption may be advisable.

Altered or contrived photographs are a device that should not be overused. Taking photographs of unidentified real people as illustrations of a generic type or a generic situation (like using stock images) usually turns out to be a bad idea.

If you have any question about the appropriateness of an alteration or are not sure how best to make clear to the reader that the image has been manipulated or the scene contrived, consult upstream.
Use of Wikipedia

Unlike older news operations, we consider Wikipedia to be useful. That is to say: it cannot be cited as a primary source, but is a useful way of finding key arguments, texts, data and other sources in a particular topic.


# Language Guide

The linguist Paul Grice examined the structure of effective conversations. His work [5] gives us four principles, or maxims, to observe at all times:

    1) The maxim of quantity, where one tries to be as informative as one possibly can, and gives as much information as is needed, and no more.

    2) The maxim of quality, where one tries to be truthful, and does not give information that is false or that is not supported by evidence.

    3) The maxim of relation, where one tries to be relevant, and says things that are pertinent to the discussion.

    4) The maxim of manner, when one tries to be as clear, as brief, and as orderly as one can in what one says, and where one avoids obscurity and ambiguity.

To help with this, a few short heuristics:

    1) Always look for and cite multiple sources. Either link them or put them in an understandable section at the bottom.

    2) Aim for a clear, direct and conversational tone. Be blunt. Swearing is fine, as long as it serves a clear purpose of conveying some useful information. We’re not here to be polite: we’re here to be right.
    
    3) Active voice, not passive. “...was stated by the CEB”. “...treasury was depleted by the banker.” These are all far weaker than: “The CEB stated that” “The banker depleted the treasury.”
    
    4) Explain jargon and acronyms; explain institutions, relations, and authority. Every field has specific operational language that makes sense to practitioners within a field. However, we cannot expect general readers to know this jargon. What is the PUCSL? What is a regulator? Even when it lengthens an article, take the time to pen a concise explanation when introducing a term.

    5) When editing, aim for a grade 8-9 readability score on the Flesch-Kincaid scale. Reader’s Digest operates at a grade 8-9 level; Time Magazine is slightly lower. Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea is at a grade 4 level. Essentially, nobody should need a college degree to read our work.
    
    6) Use commas. Use the Oxford comma. This is what happens when you don’t:

    ![commas]({{site.baseurl}}/images/general/use-commas.png)
    
    7) Name first, designation second Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
    
    8) On numbers: 0-9: use letters. If you insist on using numerals, make sure it’s a double digit: 01, 02, 03. Else, say one two three. 10 and upwards: use numerals.


# Handling Conflicts

Large portions of this guide are based on the New York Times Guidelines on Integrity to avoid reinventing the wheel.
General

We engage with readers on the truth. That is to say, we speak our results and accept valid critique, but do not need to both-sides issues, simper to bad faith engagements or deal in good faith with trolls. We correct our mistakes as soon as we become aware of them and make sure our corrections are a matter of record.

We engage with sources in the same manner. Watchdog staff should always disclose their identity to people they cover (whether face to face or otherwise), though they need not always announce their status as journalists when seeking information normally available to the public. Staff members may not pose as police officers, lawyers, business people or anyone else when they are working as journalists. (As happens on rare occasions, when seeking to enter countries that bar journalists, correspondents may take cover from vagueness and identify themselves as traveling on business or as tourists).

## Sexual Harassment

Sexual harassment can involve one or more incidents and actions constituting harassment may be physical, verbal and non-verbal. Examples of conduct or behaviour which constitute sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

Physical conduct

    1) Unwelcome physical contact including patting, pinching, stroking, kissing, hugging, fondling, or inappropriate touching
    2) Physical violence, including sexual assault
    3) The use of job-related threats or rewards to solicit sexual favors

Verbal conduct

    1) Unwelcome comments on a worker’s appearance, age, private life, etc.
    2) Sexual comments, stories and jokes
    3) Sexual advances
    4) Repeated and unwanted social invitations for dates or physical intimacy
    5) Insults or condescending or paternalistic remarks based on the sex of the worker
    6) Sending sexually explicit messages (by phone or by email)

Non-verbal conduct

    1) Display of sexually explicit or suggestive material
    2) Sexually-suggestive gestures
    3) Whistling
    4) Leering

Sexual harassment grounds for immediate termination and is considered breach of contract. Depending on severity of the incident, this may be grounds for Watchdog filing a case with the police against the perpetrator in additional to other penalties.

## Obeying the Law in Pursuit of the News

We must obey the law in the pursuit of news. We may not break into buildings, homes, apartments or offices. We may not purloin data, documents or other property, including such electronic property as databases and email or voice mail messages. We may not tap telephones, invade computer files or otherwise eavesdrop electronically on news sources. In short, while we are free to call for reform, we may not commit illegal acts of any sort. Recording calls and interviews requires consent from the person being recorded.
Personal Relations with Sources

Relationships with sources require the utmost in sound judgment and self discipline to prevent the fact or appearance of partiality. Cultivating sources is an essential skill, often practiced most effectively in informal settings outside of normal business hours. Yet staff members, especially those assigned to beats, must be sensitive that personal relationships with news sources can erode into favoritism, in fact or appearance. And conversely, we must be aware that sources are eager to win our good will for reasons of their own.

Even though this topic defies hard and fast rules, it is essential that we preserve a professional detachment, free of any whiff of bias. We may see sources informally over a meal or drinks, but they must keep in mind the difference between legitimate business and personal friendship. A City Hall reporter who enjoys a weekly round of golf with a City Council member, for example, risks creating an appearance of coziness, even if they sometimes discuss business on the course. So does a reporter who joins a regular card game or is a familiar face in a corporation’s box seats or who spends weekends in the company of people he or she covers. Scrupulous practice requires that periodically we step back and take a hard look at whether we have drifted too close to sources we deal with regularly. The acid test of freedom from favoritism is the ability to maintain good working relationships with all parties to a dispute.

Clearly, romantic involvement with a news source would foster an appearance of partiality. Therefore staff members who develop close relationships with people who might figure in coverage they provide, edit, package or supervise must disclose those relationships to the standards editor or the opinion editor. In some cases, no further action may be needed, but in other instances staff members may have to recuse themselves from certain coverage. And in still other cases, assignments may have to be modified or beats changed.
Accepting Hospitality from Sources

Watchdog pays expenses when its representatives entertain news sources (including government officials) or travel to cover them. In some situations, it may be unavoidable to accept a meal or a drink paid for by a news source. For example, a reporter need not decline every invitation to interview an executive over lunch in the corporation’s private dining room, where it is all but impossible to pick up the check. Whenever practical, however, the reporter should suggest dining where we can pay.

We may not accept anything that could be construed as a payment for favorable coverage or as an inducement to alter or forgo unfavorable coverage. We may not accept free or discounted transportation and lodging except where special circumstances give us little or no choice. Among them are certain military or scientific expeditions and other trips for which alternative arrangements would be impractical — for example, a flight aboard a corporate jet during which an executive is interviewed. We should consult their supervisors and the standards editor or the opinion editor or managing editor when special circumstances arise.

Except in the case of invitations to press events, we may not accept gifts, tickets, discounts, reimbursements or other inducements from any individuals or organizations covered by Watchdog or likely to be covered by Watchdog. We may not accept employment or compensation of any sort from individuals or organizations who figure or are likely to figure in coverage we provide, edit, package or supervise.

We may accept any gifts or discounts available to the general public.

## Public relations and institutional affiliation

Watchdog staff members are free to work with other organizations, except where there is a conflict of interest: 

    1)  if the institution in question performs the same functions as Watchdog 
    
    2)  is an entity that Watchdog covers or would cover in the interests of the public 
    
    3)  where performing work or an act of public relations for said other organization would appear (whether real or apparent) to imply Watchdog’s affiliation with said organization or its goals
    
    4) or where such work impedes staff responsibilities to Watchdog

We freely acknowledge that outside appearances can enhance the reputation of its bylines and serve the paper’s interests. We are generally entitled to accept freelance assignments that do not directly compete with Watchdog. We may accept speaking fees, honorariums, expense reimbursement and free transportation from speaking engagements. We are free to discuss their own activities in public, provided their comments do not create an impression that they lack journalistic impartiality or speak for Watchdog as a whole.

We should be especially sensitive to the appearance of partiality when they address groups that might figure in coverage they provide, edit, package or supervise, especially if the setting might suggest a close relationship to the sponsoring group. We should not take part in engagements that confer or imply privileged access to Watchdog operations upon the attendees. Where in conflict, staff should disclose other commitments.

None of these restrictions should be interpreted as barring a staff member from responding openly and honestly to any reasonable inquiry from a reader about that staff member’s work. If a reader asks for a correction, or if the request threatens legal action, or appears to be from a lawyer, the complaint will be examined internally and a judgement made from the Editor.
