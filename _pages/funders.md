Over the years, people have given us money to do our various operations. A good tenet of investigative work is to follow the money - to figure out who's being paid to do what. In that spirit, and for interests of complete transparency, here's our list.

### GIZ x LIRNEasia

The Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH implements the Strengthening Social Cohesion and Peace in Sri Lanka programme (SCOPE) co-funded by the European Union and German Federal Foreign Office. They do this in partnership with the Sri Lankan Ministry of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms (MoJ) with LIRNEasia acting as a local partner for monitoring and evaluation. They funded us to:

1) Build our digital twin of the city of Colombo
2) Create and publish maps of Sri Lanka, especially around environment and land use, for 2017-2024
3) Build and publish our wiki of 70+ crops that can be grown in Sri Lankan backyards
4) Build and publish our open-source DIY agricultural sensor kit
5) Design and publish our journalism and media literacy course for young journalists and the general public

Internews is a media support nonprofit working in 100+ countries. They train journalists, tackle disinformation, and help media outlets become financially sustainable. They funded us to:

1) Pay for servers, especially our homebrew hardware, on which we store our data, processing, and backups
2) Create Watchdog.AI, which reduced to load on us having to personally answer questions by responding to our readers based on our articles. It serves 3000+ readers in a week, including some kid who managed to jailbreak it to help them write essays on Sri Lankan kings

The International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX) is an international, nonprofit organization that specializes in global education and development in more than 100 countries.

They funded us to translate, re-design and deliver a media literacy and anti-misinformation syllabus for Sri Lanka based on their LEARN TO DISCERN syllabus (https://www.irex.org/project/learn-discern). A large amount of this syllabus focused on COVID misinformation, as it was the reality of that time.
