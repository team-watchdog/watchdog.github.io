Watchdog began in April 2019, days after the Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, as a group of concerned citizens trying to counter misinformation. We did this amidst government crackdowns on freedom of expression and mass hysteria caused by fake news and rumors, building a mobile app that was used by over 200,000 people to verify information and counteract rumors in their own networks.

The original incarnation of Watchdog was staffed by volunteer factcheckers and translators. We’ve grown significantly since then, turning to deep, investigative journalism and tool-building. Many of our team have strong journalism and research backgrounds, with a sprinkling of computer science to make sure we have the tools to keep up with our ambitions.

## How we work

We've been called an “open-source intelligence research collective”, and that's fairly accurate. We use a lot of OSINT techniques - a combination of data scraping, analysis of publicly available documents and datasets, paired with old-school boots-on-the-ground journalism. And sometimes people take notice. We've shown up on places like these:

As a core part of Appendix, we also design and act as a testing ground for new technology. This includes work like Dissect and various parts of our data scraping, information extraction and archive operations. 

These are our [Operational ethics]({{site.baseurl}}/op-ethics). That's our big list of how we operate and why. And here are our [funders and affiliated institutions]({{site.baseurl}}/funders). That's our list of who gave us money and what for.
