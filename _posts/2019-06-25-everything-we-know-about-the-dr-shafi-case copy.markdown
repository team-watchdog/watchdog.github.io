The trope of forced sterilizations has often been levelled against the Muslim community in Sri Lanka. Examples are the No Limit Toffees - accusations levelled in 2012 against No Limit, a clothing franchise, of dispensing free toffees that sterilized Sinhalese women; the franchise was relentlessly atttacked by hardline Buddhist factions for years, and a mob attacked and burned down the Panadura outlet in 2014. The same logic has shown up over the years with Muslim-owned street food restaurants accused of putting "wandha pethi" (sterilization pills) in kottu.

On May 23rd, 2019, Divaina, one of the oldest Sinhala print publications in the country, ran the following front page:

This article accued Dr. Shafi Shihabdeen of the Kurunegala Teaching Hospital of forcibly sterilizing thousands of Sinhalese women and being part of an Islamist terrorist group, the Thowheed Jama’ath.

> The original article did not detail much context, as in 2019 the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, and the subsequent zeitgeist, were shared by practically everyone in the country. For posterity, we add this paragraph [from a Daily FT article in 2023](https://www.ft.lk/ft_view__editorial/No-lessons-learnt-from-Dr-Shafi-affair/58-748836):  "Dr. Shafi was detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) when a Sinhalese newspaper published a lead story claiming a “Thowheed Jama’ath doctor in Kurunegala had illegally sterilised 4,000 ‘Sinhala’ mothers.” After his arrest, the Police recorded complaints from over 1,000 women who claimed that the doctor had performed a procedure that made them infertile. Prof. Channa Jayasumana, a professor of pharmacology and a current Member of Parliament, then attached to the University of Rajarata, offered his ‘expert’ medical opinion and confirmed that such an illegal procedure has been carried out by Dr. Shafi. The outrage that followed fuelled the flames of hatred towards the Muslim community, coming only weeks after the deadly Easter Sunday attacks. Buddhist clergy and politicians were quick to jump on this racist bandwagon which ruined Dr. Shafi’s career and brought about enormous pain and suffering to his young family."

Here's everything we know about the case as of the time of writing:
