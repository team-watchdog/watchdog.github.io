## What is the Millennium Challenge Corporation?

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides economic assistance through a competitive selection process to developing nations that demonstrate positive performance in three areas: ruling justly, investing in people, and fostering economic freedom. From the outset, Congress has been integrally involved with MCC's creation, mandate, operations, and budgets.

- Congress approved the new initiative in January 2004 in the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003
- It established MCC as a government entity separate from the Department of State, the Treasury, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

## What are MCC Grants?

### Threshold Programs

Threshold programs are smaller grants focused on policy and institutional reform in selected countries that come close to passing MCC's eligibility criteria and show a firm commitment to improving their policy performance. These programs are designed to assist promising candidate countries to become compact eligible.

- Number of countries awarded: 29
- Grant Statuses:
  - Closed: 23
  - Closure: 1
  - Development: 3
  - Implementation: 4
- Median grant value: US $ 16,898,160

### MCC Compact

MCC compacts are five-year grant agreements, proposed and implemented by well-governed countries. Compacts aim to achieve poverty reduction through economic growth by targeting the principal "binding constraints to growth" in an economy. To date, the MCC Board has approved 37 compacts in 29 countries worth more than $13 billion.

- Number of countries awarded: 29
- Grant Statuses:
  - Closed: 24
  - Closure: 1
  - Development: 8
  - Implementation: 7
  - Signed: 3
  - Suspended: 1
  - Terminated: 2
- Median grant value: US $ 362,551,000

### Eligibility for Compact

To be eligible for an MCC Compact grant, the G.N.I. Per capita of the country should be less than ~$4000.

## What is MCC Sri Lanka?

We'll let the Sri Lankan MFA (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) describe it:

> Sri Lanka was selected as eligible for a Compact Programme under the U.S. Millennium Challenge Cooperation (MCC) at the meeting of the MCC Board of Directors held in Washington DC on 13 December.

> Compact Programmes are large, five-year grants for countries that meets MCC’s eligibility criteria of good governance, economic freedom and investment in its citizens. The selections are based on performance indicators of these criteria compiled by the MCC in an annual scorecard for countries under consideration.

> Following the selection, the Board’s decision was conveyed over the telephone to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, by a senior official of the MCC.

> Created by the U.S. Congress in 2004 with bipartisan support, the MCC is a unique U.S. agency that operates on the principle of delivering assistance on the basis of a long-term consultative partnership with recipient countries. Country ownership and country-led solutions for reducing poverty through sustainable economic growth are the underlying principles on which MCC grants are provided. Grants are designed to complement other U.S. and international development programmes, and to create an enabling environment for private sector investment.

> The MCC Board is chaired by the US Secretary of State. Its members include the Secretary to the Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative, the USAID Administrator, the Chief Executive Officer of MCC and four private sector representatives. The Board members are appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate.

> In December 2015, Sri Lanka was selected as eligible for a Threshold Programme by the MCC Board. Threshold Programs are smaller grants awarded to countries that come close to MCC’s eligibility criteria, and are firmly committed to improving policy performance. During the past year, MCC in partnership with the government of Sri Lanka conducted a Constraints to Growth Analysis to determine the binding impediments to economic growth with a view to designing a Threshold Programme for poverty reduction. With Sri Lanka’s selection for a Compact Programme this year, MCC and Sri Lanka will now begin to develop a much larger programme to fight poverty and improve standards of living.

> Sri Lanka’s selection for a longer-term Compact Programme only a year after being selected for a Threshold Programme is based on Sri Lanka’s demonstrated progress, including on democratic rights, since January 2015 by the national unity government.  The award of a Compact is aimed at providing further impetus to the government’s political and economic reforms for achieving sustainable peace and economic prosperity.

### The Constraint Analysis

This was an overall analysis Prepared by:
- The Government of Sri Lanka — Led by Mr. Charitha Ratwatte, Heads of Policy Development Office and Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister
- The Millennium Challenge Corporation of the United States of America
- Harvard University's Center for International Development

Separate meetings were also held with:
- Ministries and agencies
- Board of Investment (BOI)
- American and Ceylon Chambers of Commerce
- Other private sector and civil society stakeholders in Colombo

MCC and the Government of Sri Lanka agreed that the analysis identifies three binding constraints to economic growth:
1. Lack of access to land (Section 2.1)
2. Policy uncertainty (Section 2.2)
3. Inadequate overland transport. (Section 2.3)

Other issues identified in the course of the analysis:
- The capacity of electricity and access to water and wastewater services for certain industries and areas of the country.
- The shortage of skills in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).

### Access to Land (Section 2.1) — Summary

- The Sri Lankan State owns approximately 80 percent of land through multiple ministries.
- Poor coordination, slow and unclear process resulting in the inability to match the demand for land needed for private sector investment, including export-oriented FDI.
- Problems with land use and titling affect manufacturing, agriculture, construction, residential and commercial development, and tourism.
- Restrictions on land parcel size, the absence of land titles, and longstanding laws affecting rural land use all reduce agricultural productivity and rural well-being.
- Existing laws disadvantage the property rights of women.
- Development of new industrial zones has not kept pace with the demand.
- 50 acre per person restriction prevents economies of scale in the case of large private sector agriculture investment.

![land({{site.baseurl}}/images/articles/mcc/mcc-2-land.png)


### High Costs of Overland Transport (Section 2.3) — Summary

- Economic activity is concentrated in the Colombo metropolitan area and the surrounding Western Province.
- Movement of goods and people within the Western Province is increasingly problematic.
- The current state of transport infrastructure generally frustrates the development of inter-regional economic activity and arguably the suitability of locating investments outside the western region and near other concentrations of population on the island.

### Transport Project

**Objectives**:
- Increase the relative efficiency and capacity of the road network and bus system in the CMR (Colombo Metropolitan Area).
- To reduce the cost of transport in order to facilitate the flow of passengers and goods between the central region of the country and ports and markets.

**How to achieve**:
- Upgrading physical road networks
- Modernising the traffic system
- Improving performance of the public transportation system
- Introducing an enabling policy and regulatory environment
- Providing technical assistance to transport agencies and other relevant stakeholders

**The project is comprised of**:
1. Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS)
  - Reduce cost of transportation on the movement of goods and people in the CMA (Colombo Metropolitan Area).
  - Aims to reduce relative travel time by reducing traffic delays
  - Improving road safety in the most heavily congested arterial corridors
2. Bus Transport Service Modernisation (BTSM)
3. Central Ring Road Network (CRRN)
  - Reduce the transport cost of people and goods by improving five sections along the road network (Total length: ~131km) connecting the Western Province to :
    - Central
    - Sabaragamuwa
    - Uva
    - Eastern provinces

![ring]({{site.baseurl}}/images/articles/mcc/mcc-2-ring.png)


Transport project has been screened as "Category B" in accordance with the MCC Environment Guidelines because potential environmental and social impacts are generally site-specific, few if any are irreversible, and mitigation measures are generally well understood. (Annex I - 25).

The agreement highlights and raises concerns about potential land acquisition and resettlement that might be needed to facilitate ATMS and CRRN Activities. 

### Land Project

**Project Objectives**:

- Increase the availability of information on private land and under-utilized state lands in order to increase land market activity.
- Increase tenure security and tradability of land for smallholders, women, and firms through policy and legal reforms.
- Land activities build on existing government initiatives such as:
  - the Electronic State Land Information Management System (eSlims)
  - eLand registry system (eLand Registry)
  - "Bim Saviya" program, which has not been able to realize its potential due to lack of resources.

**Activities of the Land Project**:

1. The Parcel Fabric Map and State Land Inventory Activity
  - Creation of a parcel fabric map that covers up to 28% of the land area of Sri Lanka, focused on seven "targeted districts.":
    - Anuradhapura
    - Kandy
    - Kegalle
    - Kurunegala
    - Matale
    - Pollonnaruwa
    - Trincomalee
  - Builds on top of Sri Lankan Goverment's eSlims initiative.

2. The Deeds Registry Improvement Activity
  - Digitizing paper deeds, capturing key legal rights and land parcel identification data.
  - Records to be uploaded to the eLand registry.
  - Digitized records will be linked to the Digital Parcel Fabric to provide spatial context.

3. Land Valuation System Improvement Activity
  - Supporting digitization of valuation documents and government efforts to move information to the digital valuation by ICTA and the Valuation Department (Department under the Ministry of Finance)

4. Land Grants Registration and Deed Conversion Activity
  - Registration of Absolute Land Grants Sub-Activity (The Sri Lankan Government withdrew the bill referenced in this section. Hence, the section should be removed in the next version of the grant agreement):
    - Supports Sri Lankan Government's efforts to convert permits and grants in State Land to "absolute land grants" that are expected to be registered as freehold rights in land.
    - Sub-activity would support the conversion of State Lands to the private domain, creating a marketable and bankable title to this land in the name of the land holder.
    - The Land Special Provisions Act (LSPA) is expected to define the process the Government shall use for this conversion of land rights.
  - Conversion of Deeds Sub-Activity
    - Supports expansion and improvement of the "Bim Saviya" program. The Sri Lankan Government has been converting private properties from the deeds system to the title registration system under "Bim Saviya" since 2006.
    - MCC funding for this sub-activity is contingent upon the enactment of amendments to the Registration of Title Act of 1998 ("RTA") that addresses the difficulties in moving deeded properties into the title system.

5. Land Policy and Legal Governance Improvement Activity

  - The establishment of a Land Policy Research Group (LPRG) at a high level of government.
  - MCC funding will support hiring staff and equipting an office for the duration of the Land Project.
  - Objectives and responsibilities of the LRPG:
    - Direct policy studies.
    - Support Sri Lankan Government's efforts to adopt new land policy and enact supporting legistlation.
    - Technical support, organizing, public outreach etc.
